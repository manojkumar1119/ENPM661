## ðŸ“‚ Directory Overview

### **8-puzzle**
This directory contains the solution for the **8-Puzzle problem**, which involves sliding tiles on a 3x3 grid to reach a specific configuration. The solution employs an algorithm to find the optimal moves to solve the puzzle.

### **Project2**
This directory contains the implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, a classic algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, particularly useful in routing and pathfinding problems.

### **Project3-Phase1**
This directory includes the implementation of the **A* (A-star) Algorithm**, a popular pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path by considering both the cost to reach the goal and the estimated cost from the current node to the goal.

### **Project3-Phase2**
In this phase, the **A* Algorithm** is applied specifically for path planning with a **TurtleBot**. It demonstrates how the A* algorithm can be integrated with robotics for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

### Project4: Panda Robot Control with MoveIt

This project demonstrates controlling the **Panda robot** using **ROS2**, **MoveIt**, and **C++** scripts to move the robot between different states and handle gripper conditions.

### **final**
This directory contains the solution to the **Final Exam** project, which includes algorithms and implementations from the course or project work.

### **final_proj**
This directory includes all the documentation, outputs, and reports for the **Final Project**. All related files and deliverables for the project are located here.
